# Changelog

## 1.7.6 - 2026-07-22

- Add SuperGrok support through the locally authenticated Grok CLI.
- Add one-time Cursor approval prompts for Grok-native agent tools.
- Add a copy-safe local OpenCode provider configuration panel.

## 1.7.5 - 2026-07-22

- Retain multiple Claude and ChatGPT OAuth accounts locally.
- Add an active-account selector; requests use only the selected account.
- Preserve existing provider credentials during the database migration.

## 1.7.4 - 2026-07-22

- First UNN-maintained release, published as `unn-corp.ungate` through GitHub Releases.
- Require Node 22.x before starting the API or downloading a native SQLite binding; `UNGATE_NODE_BIN` is the explicit desktop-launch override.
- Treat Cloudflare quick tunnels as process-bound: a persisted URL is cleared after a previous Cursor session, and a URL is exposed only after connector registration.

## 1.7.3 - 2026-06-25

- Fix Anthropic provider errors with non-JSON bodies so upstream failures return a normal error response instead of crashing the API

## 1.7.2 - 2026-06-25

- Add Opus-4.8 model support
- Map reasoning tiers to adaptive thinking + effort for Opus 4.7/4.8 (previously dropped)
